Crunch is an Android app designed for habit forming and self-improvement. It reminds you to complete your habit, tracks progress, and allows you to pair up with a friend.

This was an App designed in Summer 2015 as part of a Facebook internship project. Our team's goal was to push it to the play store, but once the internship was over we were 90% finished and never got around to finishing. Our team has decided to open source the project so that the product can be pushed to the Google Play Store and hopefully be of use to people.

Main Features:
1. Habit Cue Analysis
2. Dashboards to view habit, track progress, see obstacles and motivation
3. Calendar
4. Crunch World: see and like others' habits
5. Pair Up: check on others' progress

Goal: Finish correcting all bugs and push to Play Store

Issues:
1. The database we used (Parse) is no longer exists so there's currently no backend for Crunch.
2. Fix database tagging 
3. random crash on Obstacles page, 
4. Like count 
5. Enable ability to save habits that you are done with
